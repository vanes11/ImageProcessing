# ImageProcessing
It is a set of some operations on image processing in computer vision.

In these notebooks, we discuss concepts such as image contrast, luminance, image contrast enhancement, image convolution, edge detection.
Regarding convolutions, it is about: image convolution by averager, Gaussian and median filter and edge detection with sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian filters.
